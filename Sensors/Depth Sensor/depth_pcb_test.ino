-----------------------------------------------------
 
Title: Blue Robotics MS5837 Library Example
Description: This example demonstrates the MS5837 Library with a connected
sensor. The example reads the sensor and prints the resulting values
to the serial terminal.
The code is designed for the Arduino Uno board and can be compiled and 
uploaded via the Arduino 1.0+ software.
